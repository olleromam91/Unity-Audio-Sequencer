///This is a rough mock up of what I had in mind for a drum sequencer using your WONDERFUL sequencer script. 
///I've got a scene made up already as a proof of concept. It's quite ugly though. 
///I'm looking to at somepoint implement this type of game/instrument into a VR space.
///I don't think anyone has made something like this yet!
///Functions and parameters to consider
  -Upon instrument selection, mix window pops up showing >> Sample playback length, sample start position, sample pitch, reverse, etc.
  -Filters and FX for each instrument in an FX window with sliders/knobs.
  -A Clear button for steps
  -A Tempo Slider
  -A Velocity selection for each step(matched to color, green/yellow/red)
  
///For the future
  -Sample panning or positioning in 3D audio in Unity!
  -Shuffle?
